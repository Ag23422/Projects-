# Ansh Sharma — Project Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my projects across diverse domains including embedded systems, drone automation, computer vision, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Each folder contains self-contained, functional modules that reflect my experience with real-world system integration, AI workflows, and secure communication protocols.
