# Ansh Sharma â€” Project Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated collection of my technical projects across domains such as embedded systems, drone automation, computer vision, and core programming. Each folder contains working code, documentation, and relevant assets that reflect my hands-on experience in system-level programming, AI integration, and real-world IoT deployment.

## Repository Structure

| Folder Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| [`basic/`](./tree/main/basic)              | Beginner-level programs and utilities focused on foundational concepts in Python, C, and logic building. |
| [`drone/`](./tree/main/drone)              | Autonomous drone system with real-time ET calculation, GPS-based path planning, onboard vision, MAVLink communication, and cloud integration. |
| [`embedded_project/`](./tree/main/embedded_project)  | Microcontroller-based real-time projects implementing sensor interfacing, motor control, and communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI). |
