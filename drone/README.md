# Autonomous Drone-Based Environmental Monitoring System

This project implements a robust, modular drone-based system for real-time environmental monitoring, including Evapotranspiration (ET) calculation, obstacle-aware path planning, secure data transmission, image classification, and cloud-backed image processing. It integrates IoT, edge computing, drone control, and AI pipelines into a production-ready architecture.

---

## 🧭 System Overview

The system consists of four main components:

1. **ESP8266 Communication Node**  
   Handles MAVLink packet relay and dynamic network fallback using repeaters and failover detection.

2. **Main Controller (Raspberry Pi)**  
   Centralized decision-making and data processing:
   - Camera-based image capture & AWS S3 upload
   - Path planning (elliptical/zigzag)
   - Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors
   - ET-based fly logic using sensor fusion
   - Machine learning-based image classification

3. **Base Station (Edge/Cloud Node)**  
   - Image stitching from S3 using OpenCV
   - Classification & analytics fallback via Lambda function
   - API endpoint for admin monitoring and pipeline trigger

4. **AWS S3 + Lambda**  
   - Stores telemetry and visual data
   - Offloads inference load from Pi if resource-constrained
   - Triggers automatic classification and returns response

## 🛠️ Features

* **📡 Dynamic Repeater Network Switching**
  Seamless fallback to government-controlled repeaters upon connection loss.

* **🔐 Tamper Detection + Failsafe**
  Forces drone to Return-To-Launch (RTL) if sensor data is corrupted or signal interference is detected.

* **📷 Real-Time Vision Processing**
  Camera captures and uploads geotagged imagery to AWS S3.

* **🧠 Intelligent Path Planning**
  Zigzag and elliptical sweeps with obstacle-aware adjustments.

* **🧪 ET-Aware Flight Control**
  Seasonal ET logic adjusts drone activity based on temperature and humidity.

* **🧬 AI-Based Classification Pipeline**

  * Onboard: CNN and traditional ML model comparison
  * Offloaded: AWS Lambda inference for scalability

* **🧵 Image Stitching (Base Station)**
  Final image merging using OpenCV to generate high-res stitched maps.

## 🧪 ET Model Logic (Simplified)

```python
if humidity > 85: return False
if season == "Winter" and temp > 0: return True
if season == "Summer" and 20 <= temp <= 32: return True
return False
```
