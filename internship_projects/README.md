# Internship Projects

This repository contains backend systems and APIs developed during internship work, focusing on scalable and real-time ML deployment pipelines. The core logic integrates RESTful APIs, vector search with Milvus, audio diarization, speaker recognition, and concurrent enrollment mechanisms.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Speaker Recognition API**: Enroll and search speakers using ECAPA embeddings.
- **Milvus Integration**: High-speed vector similarity search for embedding-based matching.
- **Audio Diarization**: Process long audio into speaker-separated segments.
- **Concurrent Enrollment**: Multi-process handling of large enrollment batches.
- **MongoDB Logging**: Store transaction details, metadata, and inference history.
- **Secure RESTful Endpoints**: Built using Flask for microservice deployment.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Audio**: SpeechBrain, PyAnnote, Torchaudio
- **Database**: Milvus, MongoDB
- **Parallelization**: Multiprocessing
- **Logging**: JSON structured logging with error handling
- **Other**: NumPy, Librosa, SciPy, Requests, UUID

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ag23422/Projects-.git
cd Projects-/internship_projects
````

### 2. Set Up Milvus and MongoDB

Use Docker or a managed instance.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Keys

Edit `config.py` to include Mongo URI, Milvus host, etc.

### 5. Run the Flask Server

```bash
python api_routes.py
```

## 🔄 Sample Endpoints

* **POST** `/enroll`
  Enroll a speaker with audio and metadata

* **POST** `/search`
  Find best match for an audio query using cosine similarity

* **POST** `/diarize`
  Separate long audio into speaker-wise segments

* **POST** `/enroll_batch`
  Multi-process enrollment of a directory of audio files

---

## 📈 Example Use Cases
